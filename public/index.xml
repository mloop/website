      <description>Recently I was asked by a colleague what the benefits of Bayesian analysis were. This essay represents my thinking as of today, about 10 years into being a statistician and ~2 years actually practicing some Bayesian analysis.
We all want to fit models to data that increase our understanding and make clear what we should do next. As a population health scientist, Iâ€™m often interested in estimating the effect of an exposure on an outcome.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m an Assistant Professor in the Division of Pharmacotherapy and Experimental Therapeutics at the UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I am trained as a biostatistician and epidemiologist, with a focus on cardiovascular diseases, as well as developing interests in pregnancy and neonatal care.
I am a budding applied Bayesian statistician, and I also have experience in spatial statistics, survival analysis, and machine learning.</description>
